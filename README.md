### Summary

This application allows users to create a list of tasks they are currently working on, along with hours and priority for each task. Users can filter tasks by an alphabetic character, sort by priority/hours/name, and search for tasks in their list. This application also implements a leveling system for each user based on their total amount of hours logged. 

### Motivation

While in-between jobs, I have been constantly teaching myself various languages and technologies, and find it difficult to remember how much time I have spent on projects/learning. I also found it difficult to assign priorities to various tasks. So, I created this application to allow you to store total hours logged and priority for each task you are currently working on, all in one place.
